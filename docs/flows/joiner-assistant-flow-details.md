# New Joiner Assistant Flow Blueprint

This blueprint describes the end-to-end Power Virtual Agents topics and Power Automate flows for the New Joiner Assistant (AI FAQ, Document Navigator, Quiz, Gamification, and Progress Tracking).

## A. Power Virtual Agents Topics

1. **AI FAQ Bot**
   - Connect a PVA topic to the SharePoint FAQ list using the *List Records* action.
   - (Optional) Add an Azure OpenAI call to answer FAQs conversationally.

2. **Document Navigator**
   - PVA topic queries SharePoint Document Library or list of onboarding resources.
   - Returns link attachments via Adaptive Cards.

3. **Onboarding Checklist & Progress Tracker**
   - Trigger PVA to list tasks from the Onboarding Tasks SharePoint list.
   - Use an Adaptive Card that shows each task name, due date, and status.
   - Allow user to mark tasks done via Action.Submit and invoke Power Automate.

4. **Interactive Quiz**
   - PVA topic uses the Quiz Adaptive Card JSON template.
   - Pull a quiz row from Excel and populate `Question` and `choices` dynamically.
   - Post Adaptive Card (using `templates/quiz-adaptive-card.json`) and wait for response.
   - The userâ€™s answer is returned to the flow for scoring.

## B. Power Automate Flow Components

### 1. Award Points & Badges
#### 1. Award Points & Badges Flow

This flow awards points (and optional badges) when a user completes a task or answers a quiz correctly.

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Create the flow**
   - In Power Automate, click **Create** â†’ **Automated cloud flow**.
   - Name it **Award Points Flow** and select trigger **When an item is modified** (SharePoint).

2. **Configure trigger condition (tasks only)**
   - Open trigger settings (Â·Â·Â· â†’ Settings) and under **Trigger Conditions** add:
     ```
     @equals(triggerBody()?['Status'], 'Done')
     ```

3. **Fetch task item and current points**
   - Add **Get item** (SharePoint): use same Site Address and List Name, set **Id** to **ID** from trigger.
   - Add **Initialize variable** (`currentPoints`, Type: Integer) with value **Points** (from Get item).

4. **Calculate new points**
   - Add **Compose** (rename to **addPoints**) with **Points** from the trigger (task row).
   - Add **Compose** (rename to **newPoints**) with expression:
     ```
     add(variables('currentPoints'), outputs('addPoints'))
     ```

5. **Update task item**
   - Add **Update item** (SharePoint) and set **Points** field to **Outputs** of **newPoints**.

6. **Handle quiz submissions (parallel branch)**
   - Create a branch triggered by **When a new row is added** (Excel Online): Quizzes table in OneDrive.
   - Add a **Condition** to compare **Submitted Answer** to **Correct Option**.
   - Under **If yes**, replicate steps 3â€“5 using the quiz rowâ€™s Points value.

7. **Optional: Notify user in Teams**
   - After updating points, add **Post a message (V3)** (Microsoft Teams) to congratulate the user and show their new point total.

8. **Return data to PVA**
   - At the end of the flow, use **Respond to Power Virtual Agents** action to send success/failure status back to the bot.

### 2. Progress Update Notification
#### 2. Progress Update Notification Flow

This scheduled flow sends users or HR a summary of onboarding progress.

1. **Create the flow**
   - In Power Automate, click **Create** â†’ **Scheduled cloud flow**.
   - Name it **Onboarding Progress Notification** and set the schedule (e.g. daily at 8:00â€¯AM).

2. **Retrieve tasks**
   - Add **List items** (SharePoint) for the Onboarding Tasks list.

3. **Filter and count**
   - Add **Filter array** to separate completed tasks:
     - From: **value** (output of List items)
     - Condition: `item()?['Status']` is equal to `Done`
   - Add **Compose** actions to compute:
     - `completedCount`: `length(body('Filter_array'))`
     - `totalCount`: `length(body('List_items')?['value'])`

4. **Compose Adaptive Card**
   - Add **Compose** with Adaptive Card JSON template (or use **Compose** inline):
     ```jsonc
     {
       "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
       "type": "AdaptiveCard",
       "version": "1.4",
       "body": [
         { "type": "TextBlock", "text": "ðŸ“Š Onboarding Progress", "weight": "Bolder" },
         { "type": "TextBlock", "text": "Completed: @{outputs('completedCount')} of @{outputs('totalCount')} tasks", "wrap": true }
       ]
     }
     ```

5. **Post Adaptive Card**
   - Add **Post adaptive card in a chat or channel** (Microsoft Teams).
   - Configure Team/Channel or individual chat.
   - Use **Outputs** of the previous Compose as the **Message**.


### 3. Leaderboard Dashboard Refresh
#### 3. Leaderboard Dashboard Refresh Flow

This flow refreshes your leaderboard display in Power BI or Adaptive Cards.

1. **Create the flow**
   - In Power Automate, click **Create** â†’ **Scheduled cloud flow** (or **Automated cloud flow** triggered by a SharePoint update).
   - Name it **Leaderboard Refresh Flow**.

2. **Define trigger**
   - Scheduled: set to run hourly or daily.
   - Or, Automated: use **When an item or file is modified** on the Points list.

3. **Refresh Power BI dataset**
   - Add **Refresh a dataset** (Power BI) action.
   - Select your Workspace and Dataset for the leaderboard report.

4. **(Optional) Update Adaptive Card leaderboard**
   - Use **Compose** to build a dynamic Adaptive Card JSON (similar to Progress Card).
   - Add **Post adaptive card** to Teams to replace or update the leaderboard card.


## C. End-to-End Sequence
1. User chats with PVA: asks a question â†’ FAQ Bot replies.
2. User requests document links â†’ Document Navigator posts resource cards.
3. User starts quiz â†’ PVA posts Adaptive Card â†’ user submits answer â†’ Flow awards points.
4. User marks task done â†’ Flow awards task points and updates progress.
5. Scheduled flow posts progress summary via Adaptive Card.
6. Leaderboard Refresh Flow updates the Power BI dataset (and/or Adaptive Card) to show the latest standings.

This blueprint covers all PRD features for the New Joiner Assistant.
